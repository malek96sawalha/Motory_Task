# Motory_Task

 I have implemented the specified functionalities using the Yii2 framework, ensuring both backend and frontend components are in line with the provided Figma design.

 # Backend Development:

 Service Management (CRUD):
 I have developed controllers and models to facilitate the management of services, incorporating secure CRUD operations. This includes robust validation and error-handling mechanisms to ensure data integrity and prevent unauthorized access.

 Category Management (CRUD):
For category management, I created controllers, models, and database tables. The implementation ensures a seamless CRUD experience, maintaining the same level of security and data integrity as with services.


# Frontend Development:

Header Buttons:
The header buttons have been implemented precisely as per the Figma design, adhering to specified sizes, colors, and spaces. Though currently non-functional, they serve to enhance the visual consistency of the frontend layout.

Service and Category Display:
The frontend layout is responsive and faithfully mirrors the Figma design. The displayed services, along with their corresponding categories, accurately reflect the information retrieved from the backend.

"طلب شراء الخدمة" Button:
The "طلب شراء الخدمة" button has been implemented as per the design, and as instructed, it remains non-functional at this stage.
